# Optimistic Updates w/ steriods 💪🏻

This project was made to learn optimistic updates in all new - [tanstack v5]("https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/reference/useMutation/")

### 📝 Note:

If you keep `Should fail` to true , it will reject the promise resulting a mocked db failure. This was added to show how react query handles updates if there are errors.
